# Tic-Tac-Toe
LEAP Week 12 Project

# Intro 
You probably already know how to play Tic-Tac-Toe. It's a really simple game, right? That's what most people think. But if you really wrap your brain around it, you'll discover that Tic-Tac-Toe isn't quite as simple as you think! Tic-Tac-Toe involves looking ahead and trying to figure out what the person playing against you might do next.

# MVP 
-	A simple tic-tac-toe game built for 2 players in Windows Console 
-	No crash when user input is out of bounds 
-	Detect win when 3 of same player symbols align in a column, row or diagonal pattern
-	Detect draw if there is no winner 
-	Allow input from 2 players
-	Display a dynamic gameboard for players to track their symbols and moves 
-	Welcome message with player icon explanation and instructions on how to play 

# Instructions
1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
2. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
